# 2D Action-Adventure Game Design Document

## Overview
Design a fully playable 2D single-player action-adventure game that delivers an immersive experience emphasizing storytelling, movement, and combat. The game should feature hundreds of branching paths and endings, providing a rich, replayable experience.

## Storytelling
- **Branching Narrative**: Every player choice should affect relationships, environments, and future events.
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Include decisions that have meaningful consequences on the story and characters.
- **Hidden Lore**: Add secrets and optional story arcs to encourage exploration.
- **Multiple Arcs**: Ensure storylines converge or diverge based on player choices, creating hundreds of possible endings.

## Movement & Combat
- **Player Movement**: Smooth and responsive 2D movement including jumping, dodging, climbing, and environmental interactions.
- **Combat Mechanics**: Include combos, counters, and tactical positioning.
- **Interactions**: Players can use the environment in combat, puzzles, and exploration.

## Bosses & Enemy AI
- **Boss Fights**: Each boss should have unique abilities, multi-phase fights, and telegraphed attacks.
- **Adaptive AI**: Bosses and enemies adapt to player behavior, employing strategies like ambushes or counterplay.
- **Enemy Variety**: Include a diverse set of enemies with distinct attack patterns and abilities.
- **Allies**: Friendly NPCs should support the player intelligently when applicable.

## Branching System
- **Player Choices**: Influence future encounters, dungeon layouts, boss strategies, and story outcomes.
- **Tracking System**: Keep record of player decisions to generate hundreds of possible endings.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle complex branching without breaking gameplay balance.

## Deliverables
1. Complete scripted story with all branching paths and dialogue.
2. Fully implemented 2D game world with movement, combat, and interactive objects.
3. All boss fights and enemy encounters coded with adaptive AI.
4. Game engine logic managing branching paths, player decisions, and endings.
5. Placeholder assets (sprites, tiles, attacks) and instructions for integration.
6. Scalable system supporting hundreds of endings while maintaining balance.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure smooth performance and responsive controls.
- Focus on replayability through meaningful choices and branching storylines.
- Use placeholders for assets if necessary but maintain clarity for future integration.
